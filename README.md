About Tryton Resources
======================

Tryton is a great and live project. But we fell it could use better public relations and communication in order to grow. It has a very active developer community and many interesting connected projects (such as new web cliente Sao, and GNU Health, a complete health management solution). But Tryton remains somehow still largely unknown to the broad developer community.

This document is an initiative to increase the awareness arround Tryton, and it started as a personal list of web links we have been collecting as references. We decided to publish this list to the broader community, hoping that it could be mantained and enlarged by common effort.

Rules: The link should be about Tryton, its functionalities and its development process. The link can refer to persons, companies, documentation, code examples, repositories and any other Tryton Resource. Please check the list before sending your link to avoid duplicates. Please add to the link a little comment about its content. Try to put the link on the correct category. List the links alphabetically.
